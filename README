Requirements
- VDR version >= 2.1.2

- Optional patch to integrate into VDRs original recmenu

Description:
This plugin brings the archive-hdd functionality to VDR.
Install and start it like any other plugin.
The optional patch for VDR integrates the archive functionalities into
its original recordings menu.
There is also a patch for Skinnopacity to display an archive symbol.
The symbol isn't part of this patch. Just use an 48x48px image from your
desktop environment and copy it to skinnopacity/icons/skinIcons/archive.png.

The script vdr_move_to_hdd.sh can be used with the reccmds.conf to archive
a recording. Change the mountpoint inside and use it with vdr-bg.sh or at:

Archive?: /usr/local/bin/vdr-bg.sh /usr/local/bin/vdr_move_to_hdd.sh

Make sure, that the vdr user has permissions to mount the archive-disk. Setup
/etc/fstab like this:

/dev/sdb1 /media/archive-hdd auto defaults,user,noauto 0 0

To create an archive-disk, just format it and create a text file named "hdd"
in its root. Write the archive-id in this file (8 characters max. ). This
id is used to identify the archive-disk, so choose a unique one.
